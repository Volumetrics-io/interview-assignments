# volumetrics interview take home assignments

We take pride in being as transparent as possible. With that in mind, we've decided to open source our take home technical assignments.

Each assignment has clearly defined specifications to measure skill, but we intentionally leave things open ended in order to measure creativity.

## Compensation

We understand that a take home assignment requires a larger investment of time and energy. As such, we're committed to compensating each selected candidate for their time. This is for your time and not the artifact you produce, that is yours to keep.

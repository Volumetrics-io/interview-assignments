# volumetrics interview take home assignments

We take pride in being as transparent as possible. With that in mind, we've decided to open source our take home technical assignments.

Each assignment has clearly defined specifications to measure skill, but we intentionally leave things open ended in order to measure creativity.

## Process

Our interview process is pretty standard. We start with a 30 minute initial interview, getting a sense of who you are an whether or not you're a good fit for the roll. Shortly after, you'll receive an email letting you know if we'd like to move forward, and when you'd like to receive the technical assignment.

If we do move forward, you'll receive another email containing the following:

    interview repo: <link to this repo>
    
    your prompt: <link to file in repo>
    
    instructions:
    
    1. fork the interview repo on github and clone it locally
    2. complete your asignment under the `submission/` directory in your forked repo
    3. track your progress by making regular commits
    4. When you're finished, make a pull request to the original repo, leaving any notes or instructions we may need to run your code
    
    you have X hours to complete this assignment
## Compensation

We understand that a take home assignment requires a larger investment of time and energy. As such, we're committed to compensating each selected candidate for their time. This is for your time and not the artifact you produce, that is yours to keep.

# Graphics Engineer Take Home (verrsion 2)

## Focus

- threejs, webgl, shaders
- ability to pickup mrjs

## Prompt

Using mrjs, create an interactive experience. Make sure it works well as a 2D website and also in headset (_this part might be harder since they might not have a headset yet_).

As part of this exercicse, include an object whose shader uses parametric 3D noise. What this is is totally up to you. It can be a cloud, star, lavalamp, etc.

**Requirements**:
- interactivity (clicking on links, spinning, moving, etc)
- integrate time in some way
- the base website is built using mrjs
- creates at least one new entity and assocciated system by extending the base classes

**Referencces**:
- [docs.mrjs.io](https://docs.mrjs.io)
  - the main interactive docs for the mrjs project
  - includes onboarding and code examples for the main html tags
  - also has small repls to show how you can use and live edit the mrjs html/css/js code
- [whale demo](...) _<-- what is the live link for this__
  - this is a nicely stylized and runtime optimized demo showing how mrjs can be used in a professional setting
- [main example](examples.mrjs.io)
  - this is a simple example used for debugging or testing purposes
  - it links to more specific examples showing use-cases

**Difficulty**: moderate

**Deadline**: 3 days from receiving the assignment

**Note**: Make sure that the scope of your creativity matches the time alotment. We'd rather you complete something with all features than return something unfinished.

## deliverables
- a link to a git repo with the code
- a link to the published functional demo

## what weâ€™re measuring
- code style (clarity, structure, etc)
- use of mrjs (note mrjs still is not at 1.0, so if you hit an unexpected bug, reach out or post an issue)
- creativity
